# Skuvo

Skuvo is a minimalist image-hosting app that uses FilePicker to upload and S3 to host files. It replicates the basic functionality of imgur.com but without any bloated bells and whistles. It's a quiet place to store your photos.

Skuvo is also the continuation of an incomplete sinatra app in my github portfolio called "Kevimgur".
