# Skuvo

Skuvo is a minimalist image-sharing app that uses Cloudinary to host files. It replicates the basic functionality of imgur.com including drag and drop uploading, url shortening, and user-stored images.

Skuvo is also the continuation of an incomplete sinatra app in my github portfolio called "Simcha"
